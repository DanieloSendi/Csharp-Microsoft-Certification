/*
This C# console application include the following features:
- Use arrays to store student names and assignment scores.
- Use a foreach statement to iterate through the student names as an outer program loop.
- Use an if statement within the outer loop to identify the current student name and access that student's assignment scores.
- Use a foreach statement within the outer loop to iterate through the assignment scores array and sum the values.
- Use an updated algorithm within the outer loop to calculate the average exam score for each student.
- Use an if-elseif-else construct within the outer loop to evaluate the average exam score and assign a letter grade automatically.
- Integrate extra credit scores when calculating the student's final score and letter grade as follows:
    - Your code must detect extra credit assignments based on the number of elements in the student's scores array.
    - Your code must apply the 10% weighting factor to extra credit assignments before adding extra credit scores to the sum of exam scores.

The update application needs to produce a formatted student grading report that appears as follows:

    Student         Grade

    Sophia:         92.2    A-
    Andrew:         89.6    B+
    Emma:           85.6    B
    Logan:          91.2    A-

int examAssignments = 5;
